   - Handling missing data
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling

2. **Supervised Learning Algorithms**
   - Linear Regression
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Trees
   - Random Forests
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

3. **Unsupervised Learning Algorithms**
   - K-Means Clustering

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python programming.
- Familiarity with libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn.
- Knowledge of basic machine learning concepts.

## Installation

To run the lab experiments, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each lab experiment is organized into separate Jupyter notebooks, located in the `notebooks/` directory. To start working on a lab, simply navigate to the desired notebook and run the cells sequentially.

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/<notebook_name>.ipynb
```

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to **Prof. Ratnakar Dash** for his guidance and support throughout this lab. His insights and expertise have been invaluable in deepening my understanding of machine learning.
